🔒 Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-01-03

This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications developed and published by Johan Tobin (“the developer”), including but not limited to apps such as Daily Reflex.

Your privacy is important. This policy explains how information is handled across the developer’s apps.

1. Information We Collect
a) Personal Information

The developer’s apps do not collect, store, or require any personal information, such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or user accounts.

b) App Usage Data

App functionality (for example, scores or reaction times) is processed locally on the device and is not transmitted or stored by the developer unless explicitly stated within a specific app.

c) Advertising Data

Some apps display advertisements using Google AdMob.

Google AdMob may collect:

Device information (e.g. device model, operating system)

Advertising ID

IP address (used for approximate location)

Ad interaction data

This data is collected and processed by Google, not by the developer.

2. How Information Is Used

To improve ad relevance and performance through Google’s services

The developer does not sell, store, or directly process user data.

3. Children’s Privacy

The developer’s apps are not specifically directed at children under the age of 13.

Third-party services such as Google AdMob are responsible for handling any data collection related to ads and comply with applicable child privacy laws (including COPPA) according to their own policies.

4. Third-Party Services
