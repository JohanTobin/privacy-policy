<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-01-03</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications developed and published by Johan Tobin ("the developer"),
including but not limited to apps such as <strong>Daily Reflex</strong>.
Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how information is handled across the developer’s apps.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>a) Personal Information</h3>
<p>
The developer’s apps do not collect, store, or require personal information such as names,
email addresses, phone numbers, or user accounts.
</p>

<h3>b) App Usage Data</h3>
<p>
App functionality data (for example, scores or reaction times) is processed locally on the device
and is not transmitted or stored by the developer unless explicitly stated within a specific app.
</p>

<h3>c) Advertising Data</h3>
<p>
Some apps display advertisements using Google AdMob. Google AdMob may collect:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device information (e.g. device model, operating system)</li>
  <li>Advertising ID</li>
  <li>IP address (used for approximate location)</li>
  <li>Ad interaction data</li>
</ul>

<p>
This data is collected and processed by Google, not by the developer.
More information about Google’s data practices can be found here:
<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
</p>

<h2>2. How Information Is Used</h2>
<p>
Advertising data is used to display ads, comply with Google Play and AdMob requirements,
and improve ad relevance and performance through Google’s services.
The developer does not sell, store, or directly process user data.
</p>

<h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The developer’s apps are not specifically directed at children under the age of 13.
Third-party services such as Google AdMob are responsible for handling any data collected
through ads and comply with applicable child privacy laws, including COPPA, according to their own policies.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
Apps developed by the developer may use third-party services such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google AdMob (Advertising)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each third-party service operates under its own privacy policy.
</p>

<h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
Any changes will be posted on this page, and the updated date will be revised accordingly.
</p>

<h2>6. Contact</h2>
