<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-01-03</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications developed and published by
<strong>Johan Tobin</strong> ("the developer"), including but not limited to applications such as
<strong>Daily Reflex</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The developer values user privacy and is committed to transparency regarding how data is handled.
This policy explains what information may be collected, how it is used, and how it is protected.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Information Collection</h2>

<h3>a) Personal Information</h3>
<p>
The developer does not knowingly collect, store, or require users to provide personal information
such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or account credentials.
</p>

<h3>b) App Usage and Local Data</h3>
<p>
Some apps may process basic app-related data locally on the device (for example, reaction times,
scores, or progress) in order to provide core functionality.
This data is processed on the device and is not transmitted to or stored by the developer unless
explicitly stated for a specific feature.
</p>

<h3>c) Leaderboards and Online Features</h3>
<p>
Some apps may include online features such as leaderboards.
These features use Google Firebase to store and retrieve app-related data (such as scores or rankings)
required for functionality.
</p>

<p>
The data used for these features does not include personal information such as names, email addresses,
or contact details, and is used solely to enable in-app functionality.
</p>

<h3>d) Advertising and Device Data</h3>
<p>
Some apps display advertisements provided by third-party services such as Google AdMob.
These services may automatically collect certain information, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Device identifiers (such as the Advertising ID)</li>
  <li>Device information (model, operating system, language)</li>
  <li>IP address (used to determine approximate location)</li>
  <li>Ad interaction data (such as ad views and clicks)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This information is collected and processed by the advertising service and not directly by the developer.
The developer does not have access to or control over how this data is handled by third-party providers.
</p>

<p>

  <li>Measure ad performance</li>
  <li>Improve service quality and reliability</li>
  <li>Comply with legal and platform requirements</li>

those described in this policy.

<h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
The developer’s apps are not specifically designed for children under the age of 13.
The developer does not knowingly collect personal data from children.
</p>

<p>
If data is collected through third-party services such as advertising or backend providers,
that data is handled in accordance with the respective service’s privacy policies and
applicable child privacy laws, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>

and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
